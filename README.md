This is a modular api that allows you to use the sensors on your android devices to retreive meaningful data

Ravioli Ravioli what's in the pocketoli?
You will find:
-android app that can be installed on your smartphone that retreives the data, plugs it in a csv file and sends it to a server;
-a python server that retreive the data from the app;
-a python parser that returns a list of values to use;
-a python plotter that uses matplotlib to make graphs using the output of the previous file

How?:
Download the code, you can modify it to add more sensors using the methods that we created as an example

Why?:
We wanted to create a modular api that requires minimum code to work
We also wanted to make phones with special sensors useful again

For the future:
Make more documentation and modules
