This is a modular api that allows you to use the sensors on your android devices to retreive meaningful data

Ravioli Ravioli what's in the pocketoli?<br />
You will find:<br />
-android app that can be installed on your smartphone that retreives the data, plugs it in a csv file and sends it to a server;<br />
-a python server that retreive the data from the app;<br />
-a python parser that returns a list of values to use;<br />
-a python plotter that uses matplotlib to make graphs using the output of the previous file<br /><br />

How?:<br />
Download the code, you can modify it to add more sensors using the methods that we created as an example<br /><br />

Why?:<br />
We wanted to create a modular api that requires minimum code to work<br />
We also wanted to make phones with special sensors useful again<br /><br />

For the future:<br />
Make more documentation and modules<br />
